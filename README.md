# 🍽️ Restaurant Page

Welcome to the **Restaurant Page** project, developed as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. This project showcases dynamic DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript, emphasizing modular design and efficient state management.

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Restaurant Page** serves as a dynamic single-page application (SPA) for a fictional restaurant. It demonstrates the ability to:

* **Dynamically render content**: All HTML elements are generated using JavaScript, showcasing proficiency in DOM manipulation.
* **Implement tabbed navigation**: Users can seamlessly switch between Home, Menu, and Contact sections without page reloads.
* **Modular architecture**: Each section (Home, Menu, Contact) is encapsulated in its own JavaScript module, promoting clean and maintainable code.
* **Utilize Webpack**: The project is bundled using Webpack, streamlining asset management and deployment.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Dynamic Content Rendering**: JavaScript modules create and inject HTML content into the DOM.
* **Tabbed Navigation**: Smooth transitions between Home, Menu, and Contact sections.
* **Webpack Integration**: Efficient bundling of assets for streamlined development and deployment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For DOM manipulation and application logic.
* **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the webpage.
* **Webpack**: For bundling JavaScript modules and assets.
* **npm**: For managing project dependencies.
